### ✅ v1.1 Dogfooding (Complete)

**Milestone Goal:** Apply viflo's own methodology, CI templates, testing patterns, and security scanning to the viflo repository itself — proving the toolkit with its own toolkit.

- [x] **Phase 5: CI & Security** - GitHub Actions pipeline active with pre-commit secret scanning ✅
- [x] **Phase 6: Test Suite** - Vitest suite live in `apps/web/` with coverage ratchet enforced in CI ✅
- [x] **Phase 7: Content Hygiene** - Oversized skills modularized, VERIFICATION.md backfilled, telemetry logging in place
- [x] **Phase 8: Verification & Requirements Closure** - VERIFICATION.md for all v1.1 phases, CONTENT-01 fully satisfied, requirements checked off (completed 2026-02-23)
- [ ] **Phase 9: Workspace & Developer Tooling** - pnpm-workspace.yaml added, pre-commit install automated
- [ ] **Phase 10: Commit and Verify Uncommitted Work** - Stage all Phase 7 & 9 disk artifacts, create Phase 9 VERIFICATION.md

**Plans**: 3/3 complete (Phases 5–7)

Plans (Phase 7):

- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Skill modularization (CONTENT-01) ✅
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — VERIFICATION.md backfill (CONTENT-02) ✅
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Telemetry logging (CONTENT-03) ✅

## Phase Details

### Phase 5: CI & Security

**Goal**: The viflo repo enforces quality on every commit and PR through automated CI and secret detection
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, QUAL-01, QUAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A push or opened PR triggers the GitHub Actions workflow automatically
2. The pipeline runs install → lint → type-check → test → build in sequence and fails fast when a step fails
3. A PR with a failing pipeline step cannot be merged (branch protection enforces it)
4. Committing a plaintext secret triggers the pre-commit hook and blocks the commit with an error message
5. The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and workflow file exist in the repo and are the authoritative source of these rules
   **Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — GitHub Actions CI workflow + branch protection (CI-01, CI-02, CI-03) ✅
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Pre-commit secret scanning setup (QUAL-01, QUAL-02) ✅

### Phase 6: Test Suite

**Goal**: `apps/web/` has a live Vitest test suite that runs in CI and prevents coverage regression
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: QUAL-03, QUAL-04, QUAL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Running `pnpm test` in `apps/web/` executes the Vitest suite and reports pass/fail
2. Every utility function in `apps/web/` has at least one test covering its expected behavior
3. The CI pipeline runs the test suite and fails the build when any test fails
4. A coverage ratchet script records the current coverage baseline and fails if a subsequent run reports a lower percentage

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Vitest test suite with utility functions and tests (QUAL-03, QUAL-04) ✅
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Coverage ratchet script (QUAL-05) ✅

### Phase 7: Content Hygiene

**Goal**: All oversized skill files are modularized, historical phases have VERIFICATION.md records, and LLM calls are logged to CSV
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. No SKILL.md file exceeds 500 lines; content moved to `references/` sub-guides linked from the primary file
2. VERIFICATION.md exists for each of Phases 0, 1, 2, and 3 documenting what was built and what was verified
3. A telemetry script exists that, when invoked, appends a structured row (timestamp, model, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, task_success) to a CSV file
4. The telemetry CSV can be opened in any spreadsheet tool and shows at least one sample row demonstrating the schema

**Plans**: 3/3 complete

### Phase 8: Verification & Requirements Closure

**Goal**: All v1.1 phases have VERIFICATION.md records, CONTENT-01 is fully satisfied, and REQUIREMENTS.md reflects true implementation status
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: CONTENT-01 (gap closure), CONTENT-02 (gap closure — Phases 5–7)
**Gap Closure**: Closes gaps from v1.1 audit (2026-02-23)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `microservices-patterns/SKILL.md` is ≤500 lines with excess content extracted to `references/guides/`
2. `05-ci-and-security/05-VERIFICATION.md` exists documenting Phase 5 artifacts and success criteria
3. `06-test-suite/06-VERIFICATION.md` exists documenting Phase 6 artifacts and success criteria
4. Phase 7 VERIFICATION.md exists documenting Phase 7 artifacts and success criteria
5. All 11 v1.1 requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md are checked `[x]`

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 08-01-PLAN.md — Trim microservices-patterns/SKILL.md to ≤500 lines (CONTENT-01 gap closure)
- [ ] 08-02-PLAN.md — Create VERIFICATION.md for Phases 5–7 and check off REQUIREMENTS.md (CONTENT-02 gap closure)

### Phase 9: Workspace & Developer Tooling

**Goal**: Fresh CI clones work reliably without workarounds, and developer onboarding automates pre-commit hook installation
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: CI-02 (gap closure — workspace stability), QUAL-01, QUAL-02 (gap closure — hook automation)
**Gap Closure**: Closes integration gaps from v1.1 audit (2026-02-23)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `apps/*` and `packages/*` — workspace topology explicit
2. CI pipeline uses single `pnpm install` (no separate `apps/web` install step)
3. `pre-commit install` is automated via a setup script or Makefile target
4. `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` references the onboarding command

**Plans**: 2 plans ready

### Phase 10: Commit and Verify Uncommitted Work

**Goal**: All Phase 7 and Phase 9 artifacts are committed to git, and Phase 9 has a passing VERIFICATION.md — making the committed tree match the disk state and closing all 7 partial/unsatisfied requirements
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (work already done on disk)
**Requirements**: CI-02, QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-04, CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03
**Gap Closure**: Closes all gaps from v1.1 audit (2026-02-24)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. All Phase 7 SKILL.md modularizations, `references/` files, `verifications/`, and telemetry artifacts are committed to HEAD
2. All Phase 9 artifacts (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, updated `ci.yml`, `setup-dev.sh`, updated docs) are committed to HEAD
3. `09-workspace-tooling/09-VERIFICATION.md` exists and verifies all 4 Phase 9 success criteria against the committed tree
4. Running `git ls-files` confirms every previously-untracked artifact is now tracked
5. A fresh `git clone` can run `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @viflo/web test` without error

**Plans**: 1 plan

- [ ] 10-01-PLAN.md — Commit Phase 7 & 9 artifacts, create Phase 9 VERIFICATION.md (all gaps)
