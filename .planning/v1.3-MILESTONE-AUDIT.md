# v1.3 Expert Skills — Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-24 (updated after Phase 13 completion)
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Score:** 10/18 requirements satisfied (4 phases in milestone, 2 complete)

---

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.3 Expert Skills is **in progress** — Phases 12 (RAG / Vector Search) and 13 (Agent Architecture) are complete with strong cross-phase integration. All 10 RAG and AGENT requirements are verified. Phases 14 (Stripe Payments) and 15 (Integration Review) have not been started. The 8 requirements assigned to those phases are unsatisfied, forcing `gaps_found` status. This audit is a progress checkpoint, not a final gate failure.

---

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Plans | VERIFICATION.md | Score |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 12 | RAG / Vector Search | **PASSED** | 2/2 | EXISTS | 11/11 truths |
| 13 | Agent Architecture | **PASSED** | 2/2 | EXISTS | 10/10 truths |
| 14 | Stripe Payments | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | MISSING | — |
| 15 | Integration Review | **NOT STARTED** | 0/? | MISSING | — |

**Phases without VERIFICATION.md are blockers** (per audit rules). Phases 14–15 are unverified and hold 8 unsatisfied requirements.

| INFRA-03 | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **partial** (Ph 13→12 links present; reverse missing) |

**Orphan check:** No requirements are orphaned. All 8 pending requirements are correctly assigned to unstarted phases 14 and 15.

## Cross-Phase Integration Report (Phases 12–13)

### Connected (8/10 integration points)

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| `embedding_model_version TEXT NOT NULL` convention Phase 12→13 | WIRED |
| HNSW index pattern Phase 12→13 (params deferred by cross-ref) | WIRED |
| pgvector wire format (toSql/encode by language) Phase 12→13 | WIRED |
| Option A/B convention Phase 12→13 (3 reference files) | WIRED |
| AGENT-05 cross-reference Phase 13→Phase 12 (3 link points) | WIRED |
| `document_chunks` table cross-reference Phase 13→Phase 12 | WIRED |
| SKILL.md→references/ links (both phases, bidirectional) | WIRED |
| eval.ts→SKILL.md link (Phase 12) | WIRED |

### Missing Connections

| Gap | Severity | Deferred To |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| MISS-01: No reverse link Phase 12→Phase 13 (RAG skill has no pointer to agent-architecture) | Low | Phase 15 (INFRA-03) |
| Phase 14→Phase 15 integration | N/A | Phases not yet started |

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| RAG Quick Start: SKILL.md → embed-and-retrieve → eval.ts | COMPLETE |
| Agent Quick Start: Step 1 (no tools) → Step 2 (guardrails) | COMPLETE |
| Episodic Memory: SKILL.md Section 4 → memory-orchestration.md → rag-vector-search | COMPLETE |
| LangGraph: SKILL.md Section 3 → multi-agent-patterns.md | COMPLETE |
| eval.ts after Quick Start | PARTIAL (INT-02: ID replacement undocumented in SKILL.md prose) |

## Tech Debt Summary

| Item | Phase | Severity | Deferred to |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| SKILL.md Quick Start missing env var instructions (OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL) | 12 | Medium | Phase 15 or standalone |
| SKILL.md Section 4 omits eval.ts ID-replacement step | 12 | Medium | Phase 15 or standalone |
| `search()` undefined in retrieval-patterns.md | 12 | Low | Phase 15 |
| INDEX.md description for rag-vector-search lags content | 12 | Low | Phase 15 (planned task) |
| Human verification: Quick Start end-to-end execution | 13 | Low | Manual |
| Human verification: FastAPI→Next.js SSE streaming | 13 | Low | Manual |
| REQUIREMENTS.md LangGraph version wording slightly stale | 13 | Low | Phase 15 |

## Summary Table

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 10/18 | RAG-01–05 + AGENT-01–05 satisfied; 8 pending (phases 14–15) |
| Phases completed | 2/4 | Phases 12 and 13 |
| Integration (Phases 12–13) | 8/10 wired, 4/5 flows | MISS-01 low severity, eval flow partial |
| Tech debt items | 7 | 2 medium, 5 low — all non-blocking |
| Critical blockers | 2 unstarted phases | Phases 14 (Stripe) and 15 (Integration Review) |

---

## Verdict

Milestone v1.3 is **incomplete**. Phases 14 and 15 must be executed before archiving.

Completed work (Phases 12–13) is production-quality with strong cross-phase integration. No rework required on completed phases.

**Required to close milestone:**
1. Execute Phase 14 (Stripe Payments) — delivers STRIPE-01 through STRIPE-05
2. Execute Phase 15 (Integration Review) — delivers INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03 and reverse cross-references
