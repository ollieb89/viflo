<objective>
Create VERIFICATION.md files for Phases 5, 6, and 7, documenting what was built and verified during v1.1 Dogfooding. Update REQUIREMENTS.md to check off all completed v1.1 requirements.

Purpose: The v1.1 milestone audit identified that all three v1.1 phases lack VERIFICATION.md files, and all 11 requirements remain unchecked in REQUIREMENTS.md despite implementation. This plan closes those documentation gaps and completes CONTENT-02.
Output: Three VERIFICATION.md files; REQUIREMENTS.md with all 11 v1.1 requirements checked [x].

    Create three VERIFICATION.md files based on the SUMMARYs and the TEMPLATE.md pattern. Each file must be in the phase's directory. Phase 7 has no dedicated subdirectory under `phases/`, so place it at `.planning/phases/08-verification-closure/07-VERIFICATION.md`.

    **05-VERIFICATION.md** — Phase 5: CI & Security
    - Requirements: CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, QUAL-01, QUAL-02
    - Artifacts: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json` (CI scripts), `.nvmrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.secrets.baseline`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    - Success criteria from ROADMAP Phase 5 (all 5 listed success criteria)
    - Verification evidence: pipeline triggers on push/PR, sequential steps with fail-fast, branch protection requiring `build` check, detect-secrets blocks fake secret, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `ci.yml` exist
    - Key decisions: single job sequential steps (per 05-CONTEXT.md), Prettier for lint, placeholder scripts for Phase 5 then real test suite in Phase 6, gitleaks + detect-secrets overlap intentional
    - Issues: none

    **06-VERIFICATION.md** — Phase 6: Test Suite
    - Requirements: QUAL-03, QUAL-04, QUAL-05
    - Artifacts: `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/web/src/validation/skill.ts` + test, `apps/web/src/parsing/plan.ts` + test, `apps/web/scripts/coverage-ratchet.ts`, `apps/web/.coverage/baseline.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (updated)
    - Success criteria from ROADMAP Phase 6 (all 4 listed success criteria)
    - Test coverage output: All files 98.11% lines, 100% functions, 95.45% branches, 13 tests
    - Verification evidence: `pnpm test` passes 13 tests, coverage ratchet checks baseline at 98.11%, CI step "Run coverage ratchet" present
    - Key decisions: Vitest (not Jest), `apps/web/` scope (per 06-CONTEXT.md), coverage ratchet as separate script
    - Issues: none; fix for coverage ratchet CI path (apps/web directory) was needed

    **07-VERIFICATION.md** — Phase 7: Content Hygiene
    - Requirements: CONTENT-01 (partial — 11/12 skills, gap closure in Phase 8), CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03
    - Artifacts: 12 SKILL.md files modularized with `references/` dirs (30 reference files), `.planning/verifications/phase-{0-3}-VERIFICATION.md`, `.telemetry/usage.csv`, `scripts/log-telemetry.sh`, `scripts/telemetry-report.sh`
    - Success criteria from ROADMAP Phase 7 (all 4 listed success criteria)
    - Note: CONTENT-01 is partial — microservices-patterns/SKILL.md remains 540 lines; gap closure in Phase 8 Plan 01
    - Key decisions: references/ subdirectory structure, guides/examples/checklists organization, telemetry CSV schema with 8 columns
    - Issues: microservices-patterns not fully reduced to ≤500 lines (SUMMARY incorrectly marked complete; fixed in Phase 8)

    Each file must follow the TEMPLATE.md structure: header, What Was Built, Verification Checklist (with checked [x] items), Key Decisions, Test Results (where applicable), Issues Encountered, Commit References footer.

  <action>
    Update `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` to check off all v1.1 requirements that have been implemented.

    In the "v1.1 Requirements" section, change each `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for requirements that are implemented:

    - CI-01: GitHub Actions workflow — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5)
    - CI-02: Pipeline sequence enforced — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5)
    - CI-03: CI blocks merge — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5)
    - QUAL-01: Pre-commit hooks — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5)
    - QUAL-02: Secret blocked — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5)
    - QUAL-03: Vitest suite — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 6)
    - QUAL-04: Vitest in CI — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 6)
    - QUAL-05: Coverage ratchet — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 6)
    - CONTENT-01: SKILL.md ≤500 lines — mark `[x]` ONLY after Phase 8 Plan 01 completes; for now, mark as `[~]` (partial) by using `[-]` notation with a note, OR leave as `[ ]` — use judgment: since Plan 01 runs in the same wave, mark it `[ ]` and leave to Plan 01's executor to check it off, OR mark all 10 confirmed-implemented as `[x]` and leave CONTENT-01 as `[ ]` pending Plan 01.
      **Decision: Mark CI-01 through CONTENT-03 (minus CONTENT-01) as [x]. Leave CONTENT-01 as [ ] since the fix runs in Plan 01 (same wave, Plan 02 may execute before Plan 01 completes).**
    - CONTENT-02: VERIFICATION.md for Phases 0–3 — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7)
    - CONTENT-03: Telemetry script — IMPLEMENTED (Phase 7)

    Also update the Traceability table at the bottom of the file: change `Pending` to `Complete` for all requirements being checked off. Leave CONTENT-01 as `Pending` since its gap closure is concurrent in Plan 01.

    Update the `_Last updated_` footer line to: `_Last updated: 2026-02-23 after Phase 8 requirements closure_`
