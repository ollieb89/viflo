<objective>
Update INDEX.md to ensure all five v1.4 skills have accurate one-line descriptions in their existing table rows, and add a brief intro paragraph to the top of the index.

Purpose: INFRA-01 requires INDEX.md to list prompt-engineering, auth-systems, rag-vector-search, agent-architecture, and stripe-payments with accurate descriptions. The five skills already appear in the existing grouped tables, but two descriptions are stale (auth-systems references Auth.js/NextAuth instead of Better Auth; rag-vector-search references Pinecone instead of HNSW). The intro paragraph is missing entirely.
Output: Updated INDEX.md with accurate skill descriptions and an intro paragraph.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update INDEX.md — fix stale descriptions and add intro paragraph</name>
  <files>.agent/skills/INDEX.md</files>
  <action>
Read `.agent/skills/INDEX.md` first to confirm the current state.

Make the following targeted edits:

**1. Add intro paragraph at the top** (after the `# Skills Index` heading and before the `> Complete reference...` blockquote):

```markdown
This index lists all available skills in `.agent/skills/`. Skills cover the full stack — from AI/LLM and authentication to databases, DevOps, and payment integrations. Load a skill by adding `@.agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` to your context.
```

**2. Fix the auth-systems description** in the Authentication table. The current description reads:

```
Clerk and Auth.js/NextAuth authentication, sessions, RBAC
```

Replace it with:

```
Clerk and Better Auth self-hosted authentication, sessions, RBAC, CVE-2025-29927 pattern
```

(The Phase 11 decision locked in Better Auth as the replacement for Auth.js/NextAuth — auth.api.getSession() for server components.)

**3. Fix the rag-vector-search description** in the AI/LLM table. The current description reads:

```
Embedding pipelines, pgvector/Pinecone, retrieval-augmented generation
```

Replace it with:

```
Embedding pipelines, pgvector/HNSW, hybrid search, retrieval-augmented generation
```

(Phase 12 decision locked HNSW as default index over IVFFlat; Pinecone is not the stack.)

**4. Verify the remaining three skills** (agent-architecture, prompt-engineering, stripe-payments) have accurate descriptions that match their SKILL.md content. Only edit if materially wrong — do not churn accurate descriptions.

Do NOT restructure or reformat the existing grouped table format. Do NOT remove or reorder sections. Do NOT add Difficulty or When-to-Use columns to the five v1.4 entries — they already have those columns and should keep them (the CONTEXT.md flat-table decision applies to the description format, not to removing existing columns from the table). The executor's job is accuracy of content, not restructuring layout.

<done>

- INDEX.md contains an intro paragraph near the top
- auth-systems description references "Better Auth" (not Auth.js/NextAuth)
- rag-vector-search description references "HNSW" (not Pinecone)
- All five v1.4 skills appear in the index with their correct skill-name links
- No existing skill entries outside the five v1.4 skills were modified
  </done>

Run: `grep -c "Better Auth\|HNSW\|prompt-engineering\|agent-architecture\|stripe-payments" .agent/skills/INDEX.md`
Expected: 5 matches minimum (one per skill, plus HNSW and Better Auth corrections).

Run: `head -20 .agent/skills/INDEX.md`
Expected: Intro paragraph visible in the first 20 lines.

<success_criteria>

- INDEX.md has an intro paragraph explaining what the index covers
- auth-systems row describes Better Auth (not Auth.js/NextAuth)
- rag-vector-search row describes HNSW hybrid search (not Pinecone)
- All five v1.4 skills are listed with accurate one-line descriptions
- Existing index structure and all other skill entries are unchanged
