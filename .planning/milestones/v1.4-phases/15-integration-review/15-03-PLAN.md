<objective>
Create VERIFICATION.md at .agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md recording the actual post-edit line counts for all five v1.4 SKILL.md files.

Purpose: INFRA-02 requires line counts to be measured and recorded after all edits are complete. This plan runs in Wave 2 after Plan 02 (See Also additions), so the counts include the "See Also" sections added to three files. agent-architecture at 498 lines pre-edit will likely exceed 500 lines after the See Also addition — the locked decision is to flag it ✗ and note it, not trim it.
Output: New file .agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md with a complete line-count audit table.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Measure post-edit line counts and create VERIFICATION.md</name>
  <files>.agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
First, run `wc -l` on all five SKILL.md files to get the actual post-edit counts:

```bash
wc -l \
  .agent/skills/prompt-engineering/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/auth-systems/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/rag-vector-search/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/agent-architecture/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/stripe-payments/SKILL.md
```

Use the actual counts from this command output — do NOT use the pre-edit baseline counts from the research document (416, 498, etc.) as those do not include the See Also additions.

Then create `.agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# v1.4 Skill Line Count Verification

**Scope:** All new/updated SKILL.md files from v1.4 (prompt-engineering, auth-systems, rag-vector-search, agent-architecture, stripe-payments).
**Limit:** 500 lines per SKILL.md.
**Measured:** After all Phase 15 edits (line counts include See Also sections added in INFRA-03).

{N}/5 skills within the 500-line limit.

| Skill              | Line Count | Status | Note                 |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| prompt-engineering | {actual}   | ✓      |                      |
| auth-systems       | {actual}   | ✓      |                      |
| rag-vector-search  | {actual}   | ✓ or ✗ |                      |
| agent-architecture | {actual}   | ✓ or ✗ | {note if over limit} |
| stripe-payments    | {actual}   | ✓      |                      |
```

Fill `{actual}` with the real `wc -l` output for each file.

For status:

- ≤ 500 lines → `✓` (and leave the Note column blank)
- > 500 lines → `✗` (and add a brief note, e.g. "498 lines at v1.3 close + See Also section added for INFRA-03")

For the summary line (e.g., "5/5 skills within limit" or "4/5 skills within limit") — count ✓ entries and use that count. Both outcomes are valid per locked decisions: phase succeeds regardless of whether agent-architecture exceeds 500.

Note: auth-systems does not have a "See Also" section added in this phase, so its line count is the same as the pre-edit baseline (437). stripe-payments is also unchanged (363). prompt-engineering, rag-vector-search, and agent-architecture had See Also sections appended.

<done>

- .agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md exists
- Table has 5 rows — one per v1.4 skill
- Line counts are the actual post-edit values (not pre-edit baseline)
- Status column uses ✓ or ✗ correctly (≤500 = ✓, >500 = ✗)
- Summary line states N/5 skills within the limit
- Any ✗ skills have a brief note explaining why
  </done>
  </task>

Run: `cat .agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md`
Expected: File exists, contains a 5-row table with Skill / Line Count / Status columns, has a summary line, and any over-limit skills are flagged ✗ with a note.

Cross-check: `wc -l .agent/skills/agent-architecture/SKILL.md`
Compare output to the agent-architecture line count recorded in VERIFICATION.md — they must match.

<success_criteria>

- VERIFICATION.md exists at .agent/skills/VERIFICATION.md
- All five v1.4 skills are listed with their post-edit line counts
- Status values are accurate (✓ for ≤500, ✗ for >500)
- Summary line is present and accurate
- Phase 15 is complete: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, and INFRA-03 all satisfied
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/15-integration-review/15-03-SUMMARY.md`
