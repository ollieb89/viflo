# Milestone v1.1 Dogfooding — Audit Report (Final)

**Audited:** 2026-02-24
**Updated:** 2026-02-24 (post-Phase-10 closure)
**Status:** passed
**Milestone Goal:** Apply viflo's own methodology, CI templates, testing patterns, and security scanning to the viflo repository itself — proving the toolkit with its own toolkit.

## Audit History

| Date | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2026-02-23 | gaps_found | Initial audit — all gaps addressed in Phases 7–9 but work uncommitted |
| 2026-02-24 | gaps_found | Updated audit — uncommitted work cohort identified across Phases 7 and 9 |
| 2026-02-24 | **passed** | Phase 10 committed all uncommitted artifacts; all 11 requirements satisfied in committed tree |

---

## Phase 10 Gap Closure

Phase 10 (Commit and Verify Uncommitted Work) was created specifically to close the gaps identified in the prior audits. Three plans executed:

| Plan | Commit | What Was Committed |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| 10-01 | `07778a1` | Phase 7 artifacts: 11 SKILL.md modularizations, 30 reference files, `.planning/verifications/phase-{0,1,2,3}-VERIFICATION.md`, `.telemetry/` directory, telemetry scripts |
| 10-02 | `e23b841` | Phase 9 artifacts: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, updated `ci.yml` (removes workaround), `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `scripts/setup-dev.sh`, updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` |
| 10-03 | `3e31f15` | Phase 9 VERIFICATION.md created; all 11 REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes updated to `[x]` |

Milestone completed via `108cf71` (complete v1.1 milestone — archive, reorganize, tag).

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| Requirement | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Claim | REQUIREMENTS.md | Integration (committed) | Final Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| CI-01 | GitHub Actions workflow on push/PR | 5 | ✅ passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| CI-02 | Pipeline: install→lint→type-check→test→build | 5→9 | ✅ Phase 5 + Phase 9 passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| CI-03 | CI blocks merge on failure | 5 | ✅ passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| QUAL-01 | Pre-commit hooks: gitleaks + detect-secrets | 5→9 | ✅ Phase 5 + Phase 9 passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| QUAL-02 | Secret commit blocked by pre-commit hook | 5→9 | ✅ Phase 5 + Phase 9 passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| QUAL-03 | apps/web/ Vitest suite ≥1 test/function | 6 | ✅ passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| QUAL-04 | Vitest runs in CI, fails pipeline on failure | 6→9 | ✅ Phase 6 + Phase 9 passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| QUAL-05 | Coverage ratchet prevents regression | 6 | ✅ passed | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| CONTENT-01 | All SKILL.md ≤500 lines → references/ | 7→8 | ✅ passed (all 12 skills committed) | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| CONTENT-02 | VERIFICATION.md for Phases 0–3 | 7→8 | ✅ passed (.planning/verifications/ committed) | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |
| CONTENT-03 | Telemetry script logs LLM calls to CSV | 7 | ✅ passed (telemetry artifacts committed) | claimed | `[x]` | WIRED | **satisfied** |

**Score:** 11/11 requirements satisfied in committed tree.
**Orphaned requirements:** None — all 11 REQ-IDs appear in phase VERIFICATION.md files.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Directory | VERIFICATION.md | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Phase 5: CI & Security | `05-ci-and-security/` | ✅ committed | Complete |
| Phase 6: Test Suite | `06-test-suite/` | ✅ committed | Complete |
| Phase 7: Content Hygiene | `08-verification-closure/07-VERIFICATION.md` | ✅ committed | Complete (in Phase 8 dir) |
| Phase 8: Verification Closure | `08-verification-closure/` | ✅ committed, passed 5/5 | Complete |
| Phase 9: Workspace Tooling | `09-workspace-tooling/` | ✅ committed (created by Phase 10-03) | Complete |
| Phase 10: Commit & Verify | `10-commit-and-verify/` | N/A — meta phase (no success criteria to verify separately) | Complete |

## Integration Check (Committed Tree — Final State)

**Flows complete:** 5/5

| Flow | Requirements | Verdict |
|------|-------------|---------|
| CI pipeline triggers + branch protection | CI-01, CI-03 | ✅ Working |
| Fresh clone CI pipeline (full sequence) | CI-02, QUAL-04 | ✅ Working — `pnpm-workspace.yaml` committed; workspace filter resolves correctly |
| Vitest test suite local + CI | QUAL-03, QUAL-04 | ✅ Working |
| Coverage ratchet enforcement | QUAL-05 | ✅ Working |
| Pre-commit secret blocking | QUAL-01, QUAL-02 | ✅ Working — `scripts/setup-dev.sh` committed; hooks install on `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` |

---

## Residual Tech Debt (Non-blocking)

1. **Phase 7 VERIFICATION.md disk-vs-committed discrepancy** — the original `07-VERIFICATION.md` checked items against disk state rather than `git ls-files`. Phase 10 closed the actual gap; future VERIFICATION.md checklists should explicitly verify committed state.

2. **Phase 9: Makefile vs setup-dev.sh** — `09-CONTEXT.md` decisions called for a `Makefile` with `make setup`; Phase 9 used `scripts/setup-dev.sh` instead. Same function, different interface. Minor deviation.
