# Milestone v1.2: Foundation Skills

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-24
**Phases:** 11 (scoped to Phase 11 only — Phases 12–14 deferred to v1.3)
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Shipped the two highest-priority foundation skills at v1.2 depth standard: prompt-engineering (rewrote from scratch with quick-start, applies-to schema, evaluation architecture) and auth-systems (rewrote to cover Clerk + Better Auth side-by-side, DAL pattern, CVE docs). A third gap-closure plan fixed Anthropic SDK API surface errors in the prompt-engineering skill.

Phases 12–14 (AI/LLM Skills, Stripe Payments, Integration Review) were planned but not executed — the milestone was scoped down to Phase 11 at completion time. These phases carry forward to v1.3.

## Phases

### Phase 11: Foundation Skills

**Goal**: Two complete, shippable skills are published — developers can follow structured guidance for Prompt Engineering and Auth Systems without needing any other v1.2 skill to be complete.
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (committed codebase baseline)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 11-01: Rewrite prompt-engineering SKILL.md with quick-start, numbered sections, applies-to schema, Before/After anti-patterns, golden-set eval architecture
- [x] 11-02: Rewrite auth-systems SKILL.md — Better Auth replaces Auth.js as primary, Clerk quick-start, side-by-side middleware, webhook handler, DAL/cache pitfall, CVE-2025-29927
- [x] 11-03: Fix Anthropic SDK structured output API surface (output_config / .parsed_output) — gap closure

**Requirements delivered:** PROMPT-01, PROMPT-02, PROMPT-03, PROMPT-04, PROMPT-05, AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Better Auth replaces Auth.js as primary self-hosted auth path (Rationale: Auth.js team migrated to Better Auth in Sept 2025; Auth.js is maintenance-mode)
- Decision: applies-to frontmatter schema for model-specific pattern tagging (Rationale: Instruction-tuned vs reasoning models have different optimal techniques)
- Decision: Scope v1.2 to Phase 11 only (Rationale: Foundation skills are independently valuable; AI/LLM + Stripe + integration work deferred to v1.3)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Anthropic SDK structured output API surface was incorrect (OpenAI-compatible response_format / choices[0] used instead of output_config / .parsed_output) — fixed in Plan 11-03
- Auth.js deprecated by its own team — replaced with Better Auth, authjs-patterns.md converted to deprecation stub

**Issues Deferred to v1.3:**

- RAG / Vector Search skill (Phases 12 — RAG-01 through RAG-05)
- Agent Architecture skill (Phase 12 — AGENT-01 through AGENT-05)
- Stripe Payments skill (Phase 13 — STRIPE-01 through STRIPE-05)
- Integration Review (Phase 14 — INFRA-01, INFRA-02)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- INDEX.md not yet updated with new skill entries for prompt-engineering v1.2 and auth-systems v1.2 upgrades (deferred to v1.3 integration review)
- Auth→Stripe cross-skill integration section not yet documented (requires Stripe skill to exist)
