- [x] **Phase 19: Polish** — --dry-run flag, labelled per-file output, and package.json bin wiring (completed 2026-02-24)

## Phase Details

### Phase 17: Minimal Mode

**Goal**: A developer can run `viflo init --minimal` in any project and get CLAUDE.md skill imports and safe Claude Code permissions wired in one command
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: INIT-01, INIT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Running `viflo init --minimal` in a project without CLAUDE.md creates CLAUDE.md containing a `<!-- BEGIN VIFLO -->` / `<!-- END VIFLO -->` sentinel block with `@` import lines for all viflo skills
2. Running `viflo init --minimal` creates or merges `.claude/settings.json` with safe default `permissions.allow` entries — existing entries in the file are preserved
3. Running `viflo init --minimal` a second time on a project that already has the sentinel block and settings entries completes without modifying any file content
   **Plans**: 2 plans
   Plans:

- [ ] 17-01-PLAN.md — TDD: scanSkills runtime skill directory scanner
- [ ] 17-02-PLAN.md — bin/viflo.cjs CLI entry point and integration tests

### Phase 18: Full Mode

**Goal**: A developer starting a new project can run `viflo init --full` and immediately have both viflo skill imports and a GSD planning scaffold ready to use
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: INIT-03, INIT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Running `viflo init --full` in an empty project creates `.planning/` with stub files for PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and config.json
2. Running `viflo init --full` when `.planning/` already contains customized files skips each existing file individually — no existing content is overwritten
3. Running `viflo init --full` in a project with no CLAUDE.md creates a starter CLAUDE.md template; running it where CLAUDE.md already exists does not replace or alter the file outside the sentinel block
   **Plans**: 2 plans
   Plans:

- [ ] 18-01-PLAN.md — Library functions (writePlanningScaffold, writeCLAUDEmdTemplate) + CLI --full flag wiring
- [ ] 18-02-PLAN.md — Integration tests for --full behaviours (INIT-03, INIT-04)

### Phase 19: Polish

**Goal**: The CLI is fully wired as an executable, previews its actions safely, and communicates every file outcome clearly
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: INIT-06, INIT-07, INIT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Running `viflo init --dry-run` (with any flag combination) prints every file action with its resolved absolute path and exits without writing, creating, or modifying any file
2. Every file action in a real run emits a labelled result (`created`, `updated`, `skipped`, or `merged`) with the resolved absolute path on stdout
3. `package.json` has a `"bin": { "viflo": "bin/viflo.cjs" }` field so the CLI is invocable via `npx` or a local `pnpm exec viflo` call from the repo
   **Plans**: 2 plans
   Plans:

- [ ] 19-01-PLAN.md — --dry-run flag + unified labelled output with absolute paths (writers.cjs refactor + viflo.cjs)
- [ ] 19-02-PLAN.md — Integration tests for Polish features + package.json bin wiring
