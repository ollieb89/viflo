# Viflo: Universal Agentic Development Environment

## Vision

Viflo (Visual Flow) is a comprehensive development methodology and toolchain that standardizes and accelerates agentic software development. It provides a structured 5-phase lifecycle for hybrid AI-human development teams.

## Goals

1. **Standardize Methodology**: Provide a consistent approach to AI-assisted development across projects
2. **Accelerate Delivery**: Reduce setup time and decision fatigue with pre-defined workflows
3. **Improve Quality**: Built-in planning, verification, and best practices ensure high-quality output
4. **Enable Collaboration**: Clear documentation and artifacts facilitate human-AI teamwork

## Constraints

- **Documentation-First**: All methodology must be thoroughly documented
- **Tool Agnostic**: Support multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Kimi CLI, etc.)
- **Modular**: Skills and rules should be composable and reusable
- **Practical**: Real-world tested workflows, not theoretical

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Documentation | Markdown |
| Package Manager | pnpm (>=10.0.0) |
| Structure | Monorepo (TurboRepo) |
| Languages | TypeScript 5.7+, Python 3.11+ |
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| Database | PostgreSQL, Redis |

## Target Users

- **Solo Developers**: Using AI for rapid prototyping and production
- **Small Teams**: 2-10 person teams adopting AI-assisted development
- **AI-Native Agencies**: Teams building exclusively with AI tools

## Definition of Done
