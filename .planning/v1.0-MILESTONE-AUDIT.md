# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 Foundation
**Audited:** 2026-02-23T20:30:00Z
**Status:** tech_debt — All 14 requirements delivered. No critical blockers. Accumulated tech debt needs review.
**Scores:** Requirements 12/14 (2 partial) | Phases 5/5 | Integration 9/11 | Flows 2/3

---

## Phase VERIFICATION Status

| Phase | Structure | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Score |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Phase 0: Foundation | `.planning/` root (pre-GSD) | Missing | Inferred (all artifacts confirmed on disk) | — |
| Phase 1: Core Skills | `.planning/` root (pre-GSD) | Missing | Inferred (all artifacts confirmed on disk) | — |
| Phase 2: Extended Skills | `.planning/` root (pre-GSD) | Missing | Inferred (all artifacts confirmed on disk) | — |
| Phase 3: DevOps & Deployment | `.planning/` root (pre-GSD) | Missing | Inferred (all artifacts confirmed on disk) | — |
| Phase 4: Polish & Community | `.planning/phases/04-polish-community/` | `.planning/4-VERIFICATION.md` | ✓ passed | 8/8 |

**Note:** Phases 0–3 were executed before GSD execute-phase was adopted as the workflow. No VERIFICATION.md files exist for those phases. Requirements coverage is inferred from: (a) SUMMARY.md frontmatter, (b) REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table, (c) integration checker's on-disk artifact verification.

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: New Contributor Onboarding ⚠ PARTIAL
`README.md → CONTRIBUTING.md → CREATING_SKILLS.md → .agent/skills/INDEX.md → individual SKILL.md`

| Step | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| README.md → CONTRIBUTING.md | ✓ PASS | Line 147: `[Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)` (fixed in 04-04) |
| CONTRIBUTING.md setup | ✗ BREAK | Step 3: `pip3 install -r scripts/requirements.txt` — **file does not exist** |
| CONTRIBUTING.md → CREATING_SKILLS.md | ✓ PASS | Links exist; file present (283 lines) |
| CREATING_SKILLS.md → INDEX.md | ✓ PASS | `.agent/skills/INDEX.md` (169 lines, 34 skills) |
| INDEX.md → individual skills | ✓ PASS | All 34 linked SKILL.md files confirmed on disk |

**Break:** CONTRIBUTING.md Step 3 `pip3 install` will fail for every new contributor.

### Flow 2: New Project Setup ✓ COMPLETE
`AGENTS.md → .agent/skills/ → skill usage`

All steps pass. AGENTS.md current, INDEX.md accurate, 33/34 skills have no broken sub-references. One minor broken link in `frontend-dev-guidelines` (`../../vite.config.ts`) does not block the flow.

### Flow 3: Skill Development via GSD ✓ COMPLETE
`gsd-workflow → discuss → plan → execute → skill created`

All artifacts present: 12 helper scripts, 9 planning templates, reference docs, examples.

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Phase Pair | Connection | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 → Phase 1 | GSD templates used by all phases | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 0 → Phase 4 | AGENTS.md updated with INDEX.md + 35 skills | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | i18n-implementation links back to frontend-dev-guidelines | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | database-design + backend-dev-guidelines cross-ref | ◆ PARTIAL |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | e2e-testing wired into ci-cd-pipelines test steps | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | database-design postgres-setup in containerization | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 3 → Phase 4 | All Phase 3 skills in INDEX.md and README skills table | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 4 → All | INDEX.md accurately lists all skills, README entry point current | ✓ WIRED |

## Tech Debt Register

### Phase 1: Core Skills (2 items)

1. **Broken link in frontend-dev-guidelines/SKILL.md** (line 73)
   - Links to `../../vite.config.ts` (project root) — file does not exist there
   - Actual file: `.agent/skills/frontend/vite.config.ts` (inside orphaned app directory)
   - Fix: Remove line reference or update path
   - Affects: R6

2. **Phantom `error-tracking` skill reference in frontend-dev-guidelines/SKILL.md**
   - Related Skills lists `error-tracking` which does not exist in `.agent/skills/`
   - Fix: Remove or replace with `debugging-strategies` or `error-handling-patterns`
   - Affects: R6

### Phase 2: Extended Skills (1 item)

3. **task-app template incomplete — backend only, no frontend**
   - Path: `.agent/skills/app-builder/assets/templates/task-app/`
   - Backend scaffold present; frontend was deferred Phase 2 → Phase 3 then again Phase 3 → never
   - ROADMAP marks R10 complete via minimal-app; task-app status is ambiguous
   - Fix: Either complete frontend half, or explicitly mark task-app as "backend scaffold only"
   - Affects: R10

### Phase 3: DevOps (2 items)

4. **`.agent/skills/frontend/` — orphaned Vite+React app in skills directory**
   - A complete runnable application (vite.config.ts, package.json, src/) with no SKILL.md
   - Not listed in INDEX.md; appears to be leftover from Phase 1 frontend skill work
   - Fix: Move to `app-builder/assets/templates/` (alongside minimal-app) or remove
   - Severity: Low (no functional breakage), but causes confusion in skill directory listing

5. **`.agent/skills/gsd-workflow/gsd-workflow.skill` — unexplained binary archive**
   - Confirmed ZIP/binary by `PK` magic bytes
   - Not referenced in SKILL.md or any documentation
   - Fix: Document purpose or remove
   - Severity: Low

### Phase 4: Polish & Community (1 item)

6. **CONTRIBUTING.md Step 3 references `scripts/requirements.txt` which does not exist**
   - Breaks: `pip3 install -r scripts/requirements.txt`
   - Impact: Every new contributor following setup instructions will get a pip error
   - Fix: Create `scripts/requirements.txt` (if Python scripts have deps) or remove the pip install step
   - Severity: **High** — breaks the new contributor onboarding flow

---

## Summary

**6 total** tech debt items across 4 phases. No requirement is fully unsatisfied — all 14 deliverables are present and functional. Two requirements (R6, R10) are **partial** due to quality issues (broken links, incomplete template).

The single **high-severity** item is the missing `scripts/requirements.txt` that breaks new contributor setup. All other items are low-severity documentation and cleanup issues.
