<objective>
Add bidirectional "See Also" sections to the bottom of rag-vector-search, agent-architecture, and prompt-engineering SKILL.md files at their three integration seams.

Purpose: INFRA-03 requires cross-reference links at three seams: (1) RAG ↔ Agent Architecture at the episodic memory/pgvector pattern, (2) RAG ↔ prompt-engineering at RAG prompt assembly/system-prompt design, (3) Agent Architecture ↔ prompt-engineering at agent instruction/system-prompt design. This makes the skill library navigable across AI/LLM domain boundaries.
Output: Three updated SKILL.md files, each with a "## See Also" section at the bottom containing relative markdown links with named seams.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add See Also sections to rag-vector-search, agent-architecture, and prompt-engineering SKILL.md files</name>
  <files>

  </files>
  <action>
Read the tail of each file first to confirm there is no existing "See Also" section (avoid creating duplicates).

Append a "## See Also" section to the BOTTOM of each file. Use `## See Also` as the heading (a standard markdown h2 subheader per CONTEXT.md).

**rag-vector-search/SKILL.md — append:**
```markdown

## See Also

- [Agent Architecture](../agent-architecture/SKILL.md) — episodic memory pattern (pgvector-backed recall for agents)
- [Prompt Engineering](../prompt-engineering/SKILL.md) — system-prompt design for RAG assembly and retrieval context injection
```

**agent-architecture/SKILL.md — append:**
```markdown

## See Also

- [RAG / Vector Search](../rag-vector-search/SKILL.md) — pgvector pattern (HNSW index, embedding pipeline, hybrid search)
- [Prompt Engineering](../prompt-engineering/SKILL.md) — system-prompt design for agent instruction structure
```

Note: agent-architecture/SKILL.md already contains an inline reference to rag-vector-search at line 361 ("See the `rag-vector-search` skill..."). Keep that inline reference — it provides context within the episodic memory section. The "See Also" section at the bottom is the standardized navigation aid, not a replacement for the inline mention.

**prompt-engineering/SKILL.md — append:**
```markdown

## See Also

- [RAG / Vector Search](../rag-vector-search/SKILL.md) — RAG prompt assembly and retrieval context injection
- [Agent Architecture](../agent-architecture/SKILL.md) — system-prompt design for tool-using agents
```

**Critical warnings:**
- Use relative paths (`../agent-architecture/SKILL.md`) — never absolute paths
- Append to the file bottom — do not insert mid-file
- Touch ONLY these three files — do NOT add "See Also" to auth-systems or stripe-payments (INFRA-03 is scoped to three specific seams)
- agent-architecture is currently 498 lines. After adding ~5 lines for the "See Also" section it will likely exceed 500 lines. This is expected and handled in VERIFICATION.md (Plan 03) — do NOT trim or restructure the file to stay under 500

- All three SKILL.md files have a "## See Also" section at the bottom
- rag-vector-search links to agent-architecture and prompt-engineering
- agent-architecture links to rag-vector-search and prompt-engineering
- prompt-engineering links to rag-vector-search and agent-architecture
- All links use relative paths (../skill-name/SKILL.md format)
- Six links total — three seams × two directions each
- auth-systems and stripe-payments SKILL.md files are unchanged

Run to confirm all six cross-references are present:
```bash
grep -c "../agent-architecture\|../rag-vector-search\|../prompt-engineering" \
  .agent/skills/rag-vector-search/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/agent-architecture/SKILL.md \
  .agent/skills/prompt-engineering/SKILL.md
```
Each file should show count ≥ 2 (two outbound links per file).

Confirm files NOT modified:
```bash
git diff --name-only .agent/skills/auth-systems/SKILL.md .agent/skills/stripe-payments/SKILL.md
```
Expected: no output (no changes).

<success_criteria>
- Three SKILL.md files each have a "## See Also" section appended at the bottom
- Six relative links exist in total — two per file, covering all three seams bidirectionally
- No absolute paths in any link
- auth-systems and stripe-payments SKILL.md files are unmodified
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/15-integration-review/15-02-SUMMARY.md`
