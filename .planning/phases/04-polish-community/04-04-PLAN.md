<objective>
Close two README.md documentation gaps found during verification: (1) the i18n-implementation skill is missing from the Available Skills table and the skill count is stale at 34, and (2) the Contributing section links to docs/overview.md instead of the newly created CONTRIBUTING.md.

Purpose: These are the final two wiring gaps preventing Phase 4 from reaching full verification score (6/8 → 8/8). Both gaps make Phase 4 deliverables unreachable from the project entry point.
Output: README.md with accurate skill count (35), i18n-implementation in the skills table, and a working link to CONTRIBUTING.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix README skill count, add i18n row, and fix Contributing link</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Make three targeted edits to README.md:

**Edit 1 — Key Features section (line ~13):**
Change: `**34 Reusable Skills**`
To:     `**35 Reusable Skills**`

**Edit 2 — Project Structure comment (line ~133):**
Change: `│   ├── skills/             # 34 reusable skill packages`
To:     `│   ├── skills/             # 35 reusable skill packages`

**Edit 3 — Available Skills table:**
Add a new row for `i18n-implementation` in the **Workflows** category (alphabetically between `monorepo-management` and `workflow-orchestration-patterns`):

```
| **Workflows** | `i18n-implementation` | Next.js i18n with next-i18next, RTL, Intl API |
```

The current Workflows rows are:
```
| **Workflows** | `monorepo-management` | Turborepo/Nx/pnpm workspace management |
| **Workflows** | `workflow-orchestration-patterns` | Temporal durable workflow patterns |
```

Insert the new i18n row between them so the table remains alphabetically sorted within the Workflows category.

**Edit 4 — Contributing section (line ~144-148):**
The current Contributing section reads:
```
We welcome contributions! Please see our [Master Plan](./docs/overview.md) to understand the core philosophy before submitting pull requests. Ensure all changes follow the "Planning-First" methodology.
```

Replace the entire Contributing section with:
```
We welcome contributions! Please read our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how to contribute skills, report bugs, and submit pull requests. Ensure all changes follow the "Planning-First" methodology.

For full guidelines on the core philosophy, see the [Master Plan](./docs/overview.md).
```

Do NOT change any other part of the file. Do NOT reformat or reorder the skills table. Make only these four targeted changes.

README.md contains exactly 1 row for i18n-implementation in the Available Skills table; Key Features says "35 Reusable Skills"; Project Structure says "35 reusable skill packages"; Contributing section links to ./CONTRIBUTING.md as the primary contributing reference.

Run all checks after task completes:

```bash
# Skill count updated in both locations
grep "35 Reusable Skills" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md
grep "35 reusable skill packages" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md

# i18n-implementation present in table
grep "i18n-implementation" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md

# Contributing links to CONTRIBUTING.md
grep "CONTRIBUTING.md" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md

# Old stale count no longer present
! grep "34 Reusable Skills" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md
! grep "34 reusable skill packages" /home/ollie/Development/Tools/viflo/README.md
```

All five checks must pass.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
README.md accurately reflects Phase 4 deliverables:
- Skill count is 35 in both locations (Key Features + Project Structure)
- i18n-implementation appears in the Available Skills table under Workflows
- Contributing section links directly to CONTRIBUTING.md
- No stale "34" counts remain in the file
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-polish-community/04-04-SUMMARY.md`
