### Override Checklist (required with `ci-override`)

- [ ] I documented reason, scope, tracking link, expiry, and approver evidence.
- [ ] Scope explicitly names impacted gate(s) and whether condition is `skip` or `fail`.
- [ ] The label applier and approver are in the authorized override team.
- [ ] I understand `ci-override` may persist through merge only when evidence is complete.
