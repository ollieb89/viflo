# Phase 2 Implementation Complete: Architectural Design Skill

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2026-02-18

## Deliverables
1.  **New Skill**: `architectural-design` created in `.agent/skills/architectural-design/`
    -   `SKILL.md`: Documented "Planning-First" methodology.
    -   `templates/PLAN.md`: Blueprint template for future projects.
    -   `templates/TASKS.md`: Task backlog template.
    -   `scripts/init_architecture.py`: Automation script for scaffolding planning docs.

2.  **Project Artifacts**: Generated using the new skill for "Universal Agentic Development Environment"
    -   `docs/planning/PLAN.md`: Created with project constraints (Next.js 16, Supabase, Vercel).
    -   `docs/planning/TASKS.md`: Created with implementation backlog.

## Verification
-   Script executed successfully.
-   Artifacts contain correct project-specific details (Goal, Tech Stack, Constraints).
