# Turborepo + Playwright Rules

## Purpose

Run end-to-end tests reliably with dependency awareness.

---

## Mandatory Usage

- Isolate Playwright in a test package
- E2E tests depend on `build`

---

## Prohibited Usage

- Caching watch mode

---

## Tasks

- `test:e2e`: cacheable
- `test:e2e:watch`: persistent
