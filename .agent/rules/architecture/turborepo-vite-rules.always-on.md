# Turborepo + Vite Rules

## Purpose

Ensure Vite apps integrate cleanly with Turborepo caching and task orchestration.

---

## Mandatory Usage

- Vite apps live in `apps/*`
- Build outputs (`dist/**`) must be declared
- Shared config lives in a package

---

## Prohibited Usage

- Cross-app imports
- Cached dev servers

---

## Tasks

- `build`: cacheable
- `dev`: persistent, non-cacheable
