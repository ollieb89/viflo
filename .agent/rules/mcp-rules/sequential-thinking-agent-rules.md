# Sequential Thinking Agent Rules (MCP)

## Purpose

Sequential Thinking is used to externalize structured, step-by-step reasoning for complex decisions, plans, and risk-sensitive work.

## Agents must use this tool only when reasoning materially improves correctness, safety, or clarity.

## Mandatory Usage

Sequential Thinking MUST be used for:

- Planning or re-planning work
- Architectural or design decisions
- Dependency and risk analysis
- Complex bugs or performance issues
- Evaluating multiple solution options
- Blocker analysis
- High-risk or irreversible actions

---

## Prohibited Usage

Do NOT use Sequential Thinking for:

- Trivial or mechanical steps
- Straightforward execution
- Documentation summarization
- Justifying decisions already made

---

## Invocation Rules

1. Clearly state the reasoning goal
2. Constrain scope to the immediate problem
3. Reason step-by-step
4. Evaluate alternatives
5. Reach a decision or explicitly defer

---

## Output Requirements

All Sequential Thinking sessions must produce an artifact:

- plan\_\*
- decision\_\*
- blocker\_\*
- resolution\_\*
- checkpoint\_\*

Uncaptured reasoning is invalid.

---

## Tool Ordering

Sequential Thinking → Context7 → Execution

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Hidden reasoning
- Verbosity without decisions
- Using reasoning as memory
- Mixing execution into reasoning

---

## Completion Rule

A session ends only when a decision, plan, or deferral is recorded.
