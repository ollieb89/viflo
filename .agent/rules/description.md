- **Target Users**: People with dementia, caregivers, healthcare providers, administrators
- **Core Technology Focus**: Stage-adaptive UI, healthcare data management, AI/ML, real-time communication

### Domain-Specific Implementation Priorities

- **Stage-Adaptive Design**: UI components that adapt to cognitive stages (early/moderate/advanced)
- **Healthcare Data Management**: HIPAA-compliant patient data handling, care plans, medications
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, voice guidance, screen reader support, large touch targets
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: WebSocket integration, emergency alerts, live status updates
- **AI/ML Integration**: Computer vision for pose estimation, fall detection, activity analysis

### Healthcare Industry Considerations

- **HIPAA Compliance**: All patient data handling must be HIPAA-compliant
- **Medical Safety**: High contrast for critical actions, clear confirmation dialogs
- **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG AA compliance mandatory, voice guidance, large touch targets
- **Privacy-First**: Edge computing for sensitive data, encrypted cloud sync
- **Caregiver Workflows**: Streamline common caregiver tasks, medication scheduling, activity tracking

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Standards

All development should follow Senior Full-Stack Developer standards, with these healthcare platform-specific additions:

### Stage-Adaptive UI Patterns

- **Touch Target Sizes**: 44px (early), 58px (moderate), 78px (advanced)
- **Font Sizes**: 16px (early), 18px (moderate), 20px (advanced)
- **Navigation Levels**: 3 levels (early), 2 levels (moderate), 1 level (advanced)
- **Component Variants**: All components must support stage-adaptive props
- **Progressive Simplification**: UI complexity reduces as cognitive stage increases

### Healthcare Data Management

- **Patient Data**: Secure storage, role-based access control, audit trails
- **Care Plans**: Stage-adaptive plans with goals, activities, and progress tracking
- **Medication Management**: Scheduling, adherence tracking, compliance reporting
- **Activity Tracking**: Exercise, cognitive, and social activities with progress metrics

### Accessibility Requirements

- **WCAG AA Compliance**: Mandatory for all UI components
- **Voice Guidance**: Required for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full compatibility with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver

## 📋 Critical Development Guidelines

### Stage-Adaptive Component Pattern

```typescript
interface StageAdaptiveProps {
  cognitiveStage: "early" | "moderate" | "advanced";
  // Components adapt based on stage
}

// Example: Touch target sizes
const getTouchTargetSize = (stage: CognitiveStage) => {
  switch (stage) {
    case "early":
      return "min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]";
    case "moderate":
      return "min-h-[58px] min-w-[58px]";
    case "advanced":
      return "min-h-[78px] min-w-[78px]";
  }
};
```

### Accessibility Requirements

- All interactive elements must have proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation must work for all features
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards
- Touch targets must meet minimum size requirements
- Voice guidance must be provided for critical actions

### Healthcare Data Handling

- All patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control must be implemented
- Audit trails must be maintained for all data changes
- HIPAA compliance must be verified for all features

Remember: When working on GeriApp, you're building sophisticated healthcare technology that combines stage-adaptive design, AI-powered monitoring, and comprehensive care management tools to support people with dementia and their caregivers while maintaining dignity, safety, and independence.
