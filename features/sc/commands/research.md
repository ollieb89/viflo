# /sc:research

Reference command for deep research workflows.

## Intent

Perform structured research with source grounding and synthesis.

## Required Alignment

- Must align MCP server/tool usage with `features/sc/core/RESEARCH_CONFIG.md`.
- Must coordinate with:
  - `features/sc/agents/deep-research-agent.md`
  - `features/sc/modes/MODE_DeepResearch.md`

## Baseline Flow

1. Frame question and scope.
2. Gather evidence from approved tools.
3. Synthesize findings with explicit uncertainty.
4. Capture reusable outcomes in memory if high-value.
